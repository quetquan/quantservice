You can skip PoW validation for ``NoProof`` tests but also has the consequence that it is not possible to rely on/check ``PoW`` related block parameters for these tests any more.

Mu Land
-------------------------
Mu is the legendary ancient continent and the starting point for human survival and civilization.

In the Mu stage, the Quart Quantum platform will undergo a founding process, and the first batch of users will enter the platform, just like the "indigenous people" of the Mu continent. Among the earliest “residents” who contributed up to 51 accounts will become “creation nodes”. They will not only receive additional special rewards but also enjoy the right to vote in the Quart Quantum community, just like the "senators of the community". Similarly, it affects the development direction of the Quart quantum platform.

Mu-Land is the start-up stage of the Quart Quantum Platform. Just like a newly established continent, users will gradually gather here. Not only are they attracted by the huge potential revenue, but also because of their interest in Quetzal. The recognition of community culture and the pursuit of the future of mankind. User needs at this stage will be widely absorbed, and these voices will affect the future development of the platform to a large extent.

Thule
---------------
The far north in ancient legends. Its description is a bit like the North Pole, but as we know, there is no continent in the North Pole today.

As the second stage of the Quart quantum platform, Thule will become a link between the past and the next. During this period, platform users and platform culture began to converge, and more users with the same ideas would gather together. The encrypted community function of the platform would gradually be improved and opened up, and users could even conduct off-exchange transactions under complete anonymity.

Lemuria
----------------------------

Lemuria is a legendary ancient continent located in the Indian Ocean. Many scientists believe that this continent existed and hides key secrets in the history of human evolution.

As its name implies, the Lemuria period is also critical in the evolution of the Quart quantum platform. Many key elements of the platform's future development will be decided during this period. During this period, the Quart Quantum Platform will choose to launch new economic models, new derivative businesses, and new functional modules based on community opinions and voting opinions from the genesis node. The "quantum transaction" module will emerge at this stage. Contract transactions, third-party asset pledges and transactions, and "quarter quantitative" evaluation systems will also be ready one after another, and choose to choose the opportunity in this period or the next period. come out. For users in the Quart community, this stage will be a "rich and colorful" stage, with new news and new opportunities to participate in activating the market. At the same time, the gradually finalized business model during this period will Will become an integral part of the platform for a long time or permanently in the future.

Atlantis
---------------------------

Atlantis is the finale in the design of the quartet, and it is also the beginning of a new era of Quat Quantum Platform! This will be an exciting stage. The Quart community has accumulated enough popularity and strength, and the new business sector has gradually matured. It is time to set up a big ship and sail to more distant seas!

During this period, the Quart quantum platform will enter a period of cross-chain and cross-platform. New digital assets may come to the platform, and there may also be new trading models that will bring higher profit margins to platform users. The new quantum transaction model, Defi business model, and long-accumulated platform transaction volume will show unprecedented In this final chapter period, the quetzal quantum platform will be pushed to a brand new next stage: Quantum.
